# UniversalDdnsUpdater

You need to replace the variables USERNAME, PASSWORD, HOSTNAME and REGISTRARLINK with the datas you can get from your domain name registrar. Usually the username and password are different from the one you use to log in in the admin panel of the registrar, there should be a section inside the admin panel to generate them.

common registrar links are:
GOOGLE DOMAINS: domains.google.com
OVH: www.ovh.com
NO-IP: dynupdate.no-ip.com

Some registrar could need a custom update link, the legacy one and most used is xxxxxxxxx.xxx/nic/update...
